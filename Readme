This project requires python 2.7
I have used Google cloud to run the setup with as my local machine was unable to handle the computation
Google cloud give me $300 free credits and I have  run the experiment in 

Ubuntu 16.04 with 8 core CPU and 30 GB RAM


Run this commands

wget https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda2-4.3.1-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Anaconda2-4.3.1-Linux-x86_64.sh
conda install -c ccordoba12 python-pcl=0.2
pip install geo2cart


To run the code

"python Detect_Pole.py"

After running this we will get a file with the geo coordinates of poles

To check the plotting with the resultant file

"python plot.py"
